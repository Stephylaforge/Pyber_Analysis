# Pyber_Analysis
Pyber driving company Analysis with matplotlib

## Purpose
- Creating a line plot using Matplot lib
- Editing the features of style, labels, and saving image

## Overview of the analysis:
By using the data provided by Pyber ride-sharing company we are able to analyze and summarize what data can be important to make decisions and recommendations for future business to the CEO of Pyber. We will do this by using Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib to create the data summaries.

## Results:
After doing a deep analysis on this data including multiple categories of fare amounts, dates, total drivers, and total rides we come to the conclusion that each city type varies in production. Rural area's might not have a high demand for a driving company due to several reasons of pupulation and lack of businesses. Meanwhile if you consider Suburban you will find a middle ground. I would say surban's production isn't steady as seen on the Total Fare pivot table but it produced almost half as the bigger city. Then we have Urban which has the highest total rides and highest production of fares. 

### Total Rides and Total Drivers
As you can see it goes in ascendeing order from lowest to highest. This shows that the demand is high in Urban city areas which creates the highest Total Fares.

### Total Fare
The chart below shows January - April tracking of Total Fares. This is something that should be tracked and anazlyized monthly to distinguish quartley trends and how to keep fares increasing rather than decreasing.

## Summary:
To conlcude here is a summarizing statement to the CEO:
1. Market more promotions to Suburban areas to keep the Total Fare line chart more steady keeping business production going up rather than down.
2. Find a way to incorporate more Rural needs for Pyber, incorporating surverys on how to get more business possbily.
3. From my findings the average price per fare ride for Urban areas should be more due to the fact it has the highest demand.
